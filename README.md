## Update notice for ARM
For you own security, please compile your own deb package using the build.sh script located in build/linux/. It requires the libsql-dev package (apt-get install libsql-dev).

## About BitMeter OS
BitMeter OS is a free, open-source bandwidth monitor that works on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. 
BitMeter OS keeps track of how much you use your internet/network connection, and allows you to view this information either via a web browser, or by using the [command line tools](http://codebox.org.uk/pages/bitmeteros/bmclient/man).

The Web Interface displays various graphs and charts that show how your internet/network connection has been used over time.

The Monitor pane displays a graph that updates once each second, showing you what's happening with your connection right now:

The Query pane gives you detailed information about your bandwidth usage on any date/s that you specify, and lets you export the results to a spreadsheet

The History pane illustrates how your connection usage has changed over the last few hours, days, and months
